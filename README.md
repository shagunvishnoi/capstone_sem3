Frontend → Backend (API) → Database
Frontend: React.js (Vite) with Tailwind CSS.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js REST API.
Database: MongoDB.
Authentication: JWT-based authentication and authorization.
Hosting: Netlify/Vercel

4. Key Features
  1. User Authentication:** Secure registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  2. Workout Management (CRUD):** Users can create, view, edit, and delete workout sessions.
  3. Exercise Tracking (CRUD):** Users can add detailed exercises (sets, reps, weight) to each workout.
  4. Advanced Data Fetching: Searching,Sorting and Pagination
